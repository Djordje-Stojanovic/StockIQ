# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
- Achieve research quality that demonstrably surpasses Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and JPMorgan institutional research
- Generate 200-300 page comprehensive analyses for beginners or 10-20 pages for experts based on user knowledge assessment  
- Outperform OpenAI Deep Research, Gemini Deep Thinking, and LangChain implementations in analytical sophistication
- Create investment-grade DCF models, competitive moat analysis, and complete company histories
- Provide clear buy/sell/hold recommendations with price targets and expected IRR
- Replicate hedge fund-level research quality through 5-agent AI architecture at near-zero marginal cost

## Background Context

StockIQ addresses a fundamental capital accessibility problem in investment research. Superior research traditionally requires hiring 20+ PhD analysts or running thousands of parallel AI agents - approaches only available to well-funded institutions. Individual investors are consequently limited to shallow analysis from Reddit discussions, basic Seeking Alpha articles, or expensive Bloomberg terminals that lack institutional-grade depth.

The solution replicates capital-intensive research approaches using a 5-agent AI architecture: 1 sophisticated assessment agent evaluating user expertise through 20 questions, followed by 4 specialized research agents (Valuation Expert, Strategic Analyst, Company Historian, Final Report Synthesizer) that conduct parallel analysis equivalent to multiple PhD-level researchers. This breaks through both capital constraints and human cognitive limitations.
