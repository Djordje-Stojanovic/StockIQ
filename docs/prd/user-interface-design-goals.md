# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision
Clean, professional interface that mirrors the sophistication of institutional research platforms. The user experience should feel authoritative and trustworthy, similar to Bloomberg Terminal or Goldman Sachs research portals, but simplified for single-user operation. Focus on guiding users through the assessment process and presenting complex analysis in digestible formats.

## Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Guided Assessment Flow:** Step-by-step progression through 20 expertise questions with clear progress indicators
- **Contextual Help System:** Inline explanations for financial terms and concepts during assessment
- **Report Delivery:** Simple download mechanism for PDF reports with preview capabilities
- **Session Management:** Clear indication of current processing stage and estimated completion times

## Core Screens and Views
- **Home/Ticker Input Screen:** Simple form for entering company ticker symbols with validation
- **Assessment Interface:** Multi-step questionnaire with progress tracking and question navigation
- **Processing Dashboard:** Real-time status display showing current agent activity and progress
- **Report Preview Screen:** PDF preview with download options and report metadata
- **Settings Page:** Basic configuration for API keys and user preferences

## Accessibility: None
Given the personal-use nature and 2-day development timeline, accessibility features are out of scope for MVP.

## Branding
Professional financial aesthetic with clean typography and institutional color palette (navy, gray, white). No specific corporate branding required - focus on credibility and analytical sophistication rather than consumer appeal.

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
Primary target is desktop/laptop browsers on Windows 11, with basic responsive design to support occasional tablet use during report review.
