# Testing Strategy

## MVP Testing Approach

**Agent Coordination Tests**: Validate handoff data between agents
- Test research database write/read cycles between agents
- Validate metadata preservation in agent handoffs
- Verify comment attribution and cross-referencing
- Test agent workflow sequencing and dependencies

**Report Quality Tests**: Verify 200-300 page output coherence
- End-to-end report generation validation
- Content consistency across chunked sections
- Cross-reference accuracy throughout document
- Expertise-level adaptation verification
- PDF formatting and template rendering tests

**API Integration Tests**: Test OpenAI SDK and MCP failure scenarios
- OpenAI rate limit handling and exponential backoff
- MCP server connection failures and fallback
- Token limit handling during deep research phases
- Agent coordination under API failure conditions

**Manual Testing Checklist**: Step-by-step validation procedures
- [ ] Complete assessment workflow (20 questions)
- [ ] Multi-agent research coordination
- [ ] Research database integrity after agent collaboration
- [ ] Chunked report generation with context preservation
- [ ] PDF conversion with institutional templates
- [ ] Download functionality and file integrity
