# Security and Performance

## Security Requirements

**Research Database Security:**
- File-based permissions restrict access to research database directory
- Session isolation prevents cross-session data access
- Input sanitization for all markdown content to prevent injection
- Research file validation to ensure proper YAML headers

**Agent Collaboration Security:**
- Agent identity verification for research contributions
- Comment attribution and timestamp validation
- Cross-reference validation to prevent malicious links
- Research database integrity checks

**PDF Generation Security:**
- LaTeX template sanitization to prevent code injection
- Markdown content validation before Pandoc processing
- Generated PDF sandboxing and validation
- Temporary file cleanup and secure deletion

## Performance Optimization

**Research Database Performance:**
- In-memory caching of frequently accessed research files
- Lazy loading of research content based on relevance
- YAML index optimization for fast file lookups
- Compressed storage for large research databases

**Chunked Generation Performance:**
- Smart context window management to minimize API calls
- Parallel section generation where context allows
- Progressive report building with checkpointing
- Memory-efficient markdown processing

**Agent Collaboration Performance:**
- Asynchronous agent execution with coordination points
- Intelligent research sharing based on dependencies
- Context compression for large research databases
- Background processing for non-critical comments
