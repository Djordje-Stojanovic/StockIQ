# Coding Standards

This document establishes comprehensive coding standards for StockIQ development, ensuring consistency across the collaborative multi-agent architecture.

## Core Development Philosophy

### KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)

Simplicity should be a key goal in design. Choose straightforward solutions over complex ones whenever possible. Simple solutions are easier to understand, maintain, and debug.

### YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)

Avoid building functionality on speculation. Implement features only when they are needed, not when you anticipate they might be useful in the future.

### Design Principles

- **Dependency Inversion**: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
- **Open/Closed Principle**: Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
- **Single Responsibility**: Each function, class, and module should have one clear purpose.
- **Fail Fast**: Check for potential errors early and raise exceptions immediately when issues occur.

## üß± Code Structure & Modularity

### File and Function Limits

- **Never create a file longer than 500 lines of code**. If approaching this limit, refactor by splitting into modules.
- **Functions should be under 50 lines** with a single, clear responsibility.
- **Classes should be under 100 lines** and represent a single concept or entity.
- **Organize code into clearly separated modules**, grouped by feature or responsibility.
- **Line length should be max 100 characters** (configured in pyproject.toml with ruff)
- **Use venv_linux** (the virtual environment) whenever executing Python commands, including for unit tests.

## üìã Style & Conventions

### Python Style Guide

- **Follow PEP8** with these specific choices:
  - Line length: 100 characters (set by Ruff in pyproject.toml)
  - Use double quotes for strings
  - Use trailing commas in multi-line structures
- **Always use type hints** for function signatures and class attributes
- **Format with `ruff format`** (faster alternative to Black)
- **Use `pydantic` v2** for data validation and settings management

### Docstring Standards

Use Google-style docstrings for all public functions, classes, and modules:

```python
def calculate_discount(
    price: Decimal,
    discount_percent: float,
    min_amount: Decimal = Decimal("0.01")
) -> Decimal:
    """
    Calculate the discounted price for a product.

    Args:
        price: Original price of the product
        discount_percent: Discount percentage (0-100)
        min_amount: Minimum allowed final price

    Returns:
        Final price after applying discount

    Raises:
        ValueError: If discount_percent is not between 0 and 100
        ValueError: If final price would be below min_amount

    Example:
        >>> calculate_discount(Decimal("100"), 20)
        Decimal('80.00')
    """
```

### Naming Conventions
- **Variables and functions**: `snake_case`
- **Classes**: `PascalCase`
- **Constants**: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
- **Private attributes/methods**: `_leading_underscore`
- **Type aliases**: `PascalCase`
- **Enum values**: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`

## üìù Documentation Standards

### Code Documentation

- Every module should have a docstring explaining its purpose
- Public functions must have complete docstrings
- Complex logic should have inline comments with `# Reason:` prefix
- Keep README.md updated with setup instructions and examples
- Maintain CHANGELOG.md for version history

### API Documentation

```python
from fastapi import APIRouter, HTTPException, status
from typing import List

router = APIRouter(prefix="/products", tags=["products"])

@router.get(
    "/",
    response_model=List[Product],
    summary="List all products",
    description="Retrieve a paginated list of all active products"
)
async def list_products(
    skip: int = 0,
    limit: int = 100,
    category: Optional[str] = None
) -> List[Product]:
    """
    Retrieve products with optional filtering.

    - **skip**: Number of products to skip (for pagination)
    - **limit**: Maximum number of products to return
    - **category**: Filter by product category
    """
    # Implementation here
```

## Research Files & Agent Collaboration

### Research Database Standards

- Use markdown with YAML headers for all research files
- Attribute all agent contributions clearly
- Version files as v1, v2, etc.
- Keep cross-references consistent
- Maintain file metadata integrity

### Agent-Specific Standards

- Each agent must follow the base research workflow
- Deep private research should not exceed 100k tokens
- Shared contributions should be distilled and high-quality
- Comments on other agents' work should be constructive

## Testing Standards

- Write tests for everything
- Use `pytest` as the testing framework
- Test agent workflows end-to-end
- Validate research database integrity
- Test chunked generation and PDF conversion

## Security Guidelines

- Validate all inputs, especially user-provided content
- Sanitize markdown content to prevent injection
- Clean up temporary files after processing
- Never commit API keys or sensitive configuration
- Implement proper error handling with context preservation

## Performance Standards

- Monitor token usage across all agents
- Implement circuit breakers for API failures
- Cache research database content when appropriate
- Optimize context window management
- Profile memory usage during large report generation

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- **NEVER ASSUME OR GUESS** - When in doubt, ask for clarification
- **Always verify file paths and module names** before use
- **Keep CLAUDE.md updated** when adding new patterns or dependencies
- **Test your code** - No feature is complete without tests
- **Document your decisions** - Future developers (including yourself) will thank you

Simple rules. Follow them religiously.
