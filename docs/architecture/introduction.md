# Introduction

This document outlines the complete architecture for StockIQ, a personal AI research tool that surpasses institutional investment research standards through a 5-agent collaborative multi-specialist architecture. This architecture serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

The system replicates hedge fund-level research quality by deploying specialized AI agents that conduct deep private research and contribute distilled insights to a shared research database, producing 200-300 page comprehensive company analyses that beat institutional research depth while adapting output complexity to user expertise levels.

## Starter Template

**Decision:** N/A - Greenfield project

StockIQ is built from scratch with specific architecture requirements for collaborative multi-agent coordination and shared research database management. No existing starter templates match the unique combination of FastAPI orchestration with institutional-grade financial analysis and collaborative agent workflows.
