# Story 2.1: Agent Orchestration Framework

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** a simple sequential agent coordination system,
**so that** research agents can process ticker analysis in logical order with preserved context.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Agent coordinator accepts assessment results and ticker symbol as input
2. Sequential handoff system passes results from one agent to the next
3. Context preservation maintains user expertise level and all prior agent outputs
4. Error handling allows graceful degradation if individual agents fail
5. Progress tracking shows users which agent is currently processing
6. Agent results are structured for easy consumption by subsequent agents
7. All agent communications use simple JSON format for context transfer

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Stories 1.1-1.3 successfully established:
- Complete FastAPI foundation with assessment system
- Sophisticated AI-powered user expertise assessment with 5-tier report complexity
- Session management system with context preservation
- Frontend application with assessment workflow integration
- Research database directory structure prepared for agent collaboration

### Agent Coordination Architecture
**Proposed Agent Coordinator Design:**

**Agent Coordinator Responsibility:** Manages sequential execution of research agents with context handoffs and error recovery

**Key Interfaces Required:**
```python
class AgentCoordinator:
    def start_research_process(self, session_id: str, ticker: str, expertise_level: int) -> str
    def get_research_status(self, session_id: str) -> Dict[str, Any]
    def handle_agent_failure(self, agent_name: str, error: Exception) -> bool
    def coordinate_agent_handoff(self, source_agent: str, target_agent: str, data: Dict) -> bool
```

### Research Database Architecture
Based on [Source: architecture/data-models.md#shared-research-database-structure]:

**Research Database Structure:**
```
research_database/sessions/{session_id}/{ticker}/
├── meta/
│   ├── file_index.yaml          # Master index of all research files
│   ├── cross_references.yaml    # Links between analyses  
│   └── agent_activity.yaml      # Track agent contributions
├── valuation/                   # Valuation Expert outputs
├── strategic/                   # Strategic Analyst outputs
├── historical/                  # Company Historian outputs
└── synthesis/                   # Final Report Synthesizer outputs
```

**Research File Metadata Format:** Uses YAML headers in research files as defined in architecture:
```yaml
---
title: "DCF Analysis for ASML"
author: "ValuationAgent"
created_at: "2025-08-21T10:00:00Z"
version: 1
topic: "valuation"
cross_references:
  - "strategic/competitive_moat_v1.md"
---
```

### Data Models Required
Based on [Source: architecture/data-models.md#agent-context]:

**AgentHandoff Model:**
```python
class AgentHandoff(BaseModel):
    source_agent: str = Field(..., description="Agent providing the data")
    target_agent: str = Field(..., description="Agent receiving the data")
    research_files: List[str] = Field(..., description="List of research file paths")
    context_summary: str = Field(..., max_length=5000, description="Condensed context for handoff")
    cross_references: List[str] = Field(default_factory=list)
    confidence_metrics: dict = Field(default_factory=dict)
    handoff_timestamp: datetime = Field(default_factory=datetime.utcnow)
    token_usage: int = Field(default=0, description="Tokens used in research phase")
    
    def validate_handoff_integrity(self) -> bool:
        return (
            len(self.research_files) > 0 and
            len(self.context_summary.strip()) > 100 and
            self.source_agent != self.target_agent
        )
```

### API Specifications
Based on [Source: architecture/api-specification.md#rest-api-specification]:

**New Endpoints Required:**
```yaml
/api/research/start:
  post:
    summary: Begin collaborative research process
    parameters:
      - name: session_id (from assessment completion)
      - name: research_depth (comprehensive|executive from expertise level)
    responses:
      '202':
        description: Research started, returns research process ID

/api/research/status:
  get:
    summary: Get research progress and current agent activity
    parameters:
      - name: session_id
    responses:
      '200':
        description: Current research status with agent progress

/api/research/database:
  get:
    summary: Get current research database contents
    parameters:
      - name: session_id
    responses:
      '200':
        description: Research files and metadata for session
```

### Collaborative Workflow Integration
Based on [Source: architecture/core-workflows.md#collaborative-research-workflow]:

**Sequential Agent Execution Order:**
1. **Valuation Expert Agent** → Deep financial analysis, DCF models, peer comparisons
2. **Strategic Analyst Agent** → Competitive dynamics, market positioning (reads Valuation output)
3. **Company Historian Agent** → Historical context, leadership analysis (reads Valuation + Strategic output)
4. **Report Synthesis Agent** → Final report generation (reads all previous agent outputs)

**Context Handoff Pattern:**
- Each agent writes structured markdown files to research database
- Subsequent agents read all previous research as context
- Cross-references maintained between related analyses
- Agent comments system allows critique and enhancement of previous work

### File Locations
Based on [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]:

**Primary Files to Create:**
- `src/services/agent_coordinator.py` - Core orchestration service
- `src/services/research_database.py` - Shared research knowledge base
- `src/routers/research.py` - Research workflow API endpoints
- `src/agents/base_agent.py` - Base agent with research database access
- `src/models/collaboration.py` - Inter-agent collaboration models

**Files to Modify:**
- `src/main.py` - Add research router to FastAPI application
- `src/models/assessment.py` - Extend session model with research tracking
- `static/js/app.js` - Add research progress monitoring

### Technology Stack Requirements
Based on [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]:

**Core Dependencies Available:**
- FastAPI 0.104+ for research coordination endpoints
- Pydantic 2.0+ for agent handoff data validation
- PyYAML for research database metadata management
- python-markdown for research file processing

**Agent Coordination Requirements:**
- Sequential execution with proper error handling
- JSON serialization for all agent communications
- File-based research database with YAML metadata
- Progress tracking with real-time updates
- Graceful degradation for individual agent failures

### Error Handling Strategy
Based on [Source: architecture/error-handling-strategy.md#research-specific-error-handling]:

**Agent Failure Recovery Patterns:**
- Individual agent timeouts with retry logic
- Partial research completion with missing agent warnings
- Research database consistency checks
- Rollback mechanisms for corrupted research sessions
- Alternative research paths when primary agents fail

### Project Structure Alignment
All required directories exist from previous stories:
- `src/services/` for coordination and database services
- `src/routers/` for research API endpoints  
- `src/agents/` for base agent implementation
- `src/models/` for collaboration data models
- `research_database/` directory structure prepared

**New Directory Requirements:**
- `research_database/sessions/` for per-session research storage
- `config/agent_prompts/` for future agent prompt templates

No structural conflicts identified. Agent orchestration framework integrates cleanly with existing session management and assessment systems.
