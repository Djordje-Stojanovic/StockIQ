**Directory Structure:** Complete directory tree as specified in unified-project-structure.md

### Testing Requirements
Based on [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]:

**Testing Framework:**
- Use pytest as the testing framework
- Test organization in tests/ directory with unit/, integration/, e2e/ subdirectories
- Basic health check endpoint testing required

**Test Standards:**
- Test file locations: tests/unit/, tests/integration/, tests/e2e/

- Validate health check endpoint functionality
- Test environment configuration loading

### Technical Constraints
- Local Windows 11 development only
- No cloud deployment required
- Virtual environment must be `venv_linux`
- Minimal dependencies for MVP foundation

## Testing

**Testing Standards from Architecture:**

## QA Results
*Results from QA Agent QA review of the completed story implementation*

### Review Date: 2025-08-21

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

Outstanding implementation quality. The foundation is exceptionally well-structured with clean separation of concerns, comprehensive type hints, and proper documentation throughout. All 6 acceptance criteria are fully met with corresponding test coverage.

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring needed - code already follows best practices and project standards.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Line length 100 chars, PEP8 compliant, Google docstrings
- Project Structure: ✓ All required directories created per unified-project-structure.md
- Testing Strategy: ✓ pytest framework, proper test organization (unit/integration/e2e)
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 6 acceptance criteria validated with tests

### Improvements Checklist

All items below are future enhancements, not required for story completion:

- [ ] Add e2e tests when UI functionality is more complete
- [ ] Consider performance benchmarks for baseline metrics
- [ ] Implement structured logging beyond console output
- [ ] Add API documentation generation from FastAPI schemas

### Security Review

No security concerns identified. OpenAI API key properly managed through environment variables with no hardcoded secrets. CORS configured appropriately for local development.

### Performance Considerations

FastAPI async support properly configured. Application startup is fast and resource-efficient. No performance issues for foundation story.

### Files Modified During Review

None - all code meets quality standards

### Gate Status

Gate: PASS → docs/qa/gates/1.1-project-setup-fastapi-foundation.yml
Risk Level: LOW - Foundation setup with no critical features

### Recommended Status
