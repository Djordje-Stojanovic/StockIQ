## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights (Story 2.2 - Valuation Agent)
- **Working GPT-5 Pattern**: Use `respond_with_web_search()` for research, `create_completion()` for analysis
- **Token Management**: Research phase uses 32k tokens with GPT-5-mini (200k TPM), Analysis uses 12-16k with GPT-5 (30k TPM)
- **Critical Parameters**: 
  - Use `"input"` not `"messages"` in GPT-5 Responses API
  - Set `reasoning_effort="low"` to save tokens for output
  - Use `verbosity="high"` for research, `"medium"` for analysis
  - Never use temperature parameter with GPT-5
- **File Pattern**: Write two files - `temp_competition.md` (research) and final analysis `.md`

### Data Models
[Source: architecture/data-models.md]
- No specific strategic analysis models found in architecture docs
- Follow `AgentResult` model from `src/models/collaboration.py` for coordinator integration
- Research files use markdown format with YAML headers per Story 2.1

### API Specifications
[Source: Based on Story 2.2 implementation]
- OpenAI client methods:
  - `respond_with_web_search()`: For GPT-5-mini research phase
  - `create_completion()`: For GPT-5 analysis phase
- Required parameters match Story 2.2 valuation agent pattern

### Component Specifications
- Agent must inherit from `BaseAgent` class [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md#L16]
- Place in `src/agents/strategic_agent.py` [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md#L18]
- Integration with `agent_coordinator.py` service [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md#L24]

### File Locations
- Agent implementation: `src/agents/strategic_agent.py`
- Unit tests: `tests/unit/agents/test_strategic_agent.py`
- Manual tests: `tests/manual_tests/test_strategic_{ticker}.py`
- Research output: `research_database/sessions/{session_id}/{ticker}/strategic/`
  - Research phase: `temp_competition.md` (raw research with citations)
  - Analysis phase: `strategic_analysis.md` (final strategic analysis)
- Config prompts: Hardcode in agent (don't create separate config file)

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#L143-147]
- Write tests for everything
- Use `pytest` as the testing framework
- Test agent workflows end-to-end
- Validate research database integrity
- Follow Story 2.2 test patterns with proper mocking

### Technical Constraints
- Line length max 100 characters [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#L30]
- Use `py` command for Python execution on Windows [Source: CLAUDE.md]
- Functions under 50 lines, classes under 100 lines [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#L26-28]
- Google-style docstrings mandatory [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#L45]
- Type hints required for all functions [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#L41]

### Workflow from User Requirements
Based on user's specific request for Story 2.3:
1. **Research Phase**: GPT-5-mini with web search (up to 64k context) → `temp_competition.md`
2. **Analysis Phase**: GPT-5 with 16k context, medium reasoning/verbosity → `strategic_analysis.md`
3. **Same configuration as Story 2.2 but with strategic prompts instead of valuation**
4. **Follow exact OpenAI client pattern from working GOOGL example**
5. **Token limits are safe**: 30k TPM (GPT-5), 200k TPM (GPT-5-mini) support our increased limits

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Avoid Previous Story Mistakes

**From Story 2.1 (Agent Coordinator):**
- DON'T create massive 500+ line files - keep it simple
- DON'T over-engineer with complex state machines
- DO use simple sequential execution like working valuation agent
- DO test with real API early, not just mocks

**From Story 2.2 (Valuation Agent):**
- DON'T use wrong GPT-5 parameters:
  - NEVER use `temperature` with GPT-5 (causes errors)
  - Use `"input"` not `"messages"` in Responses API
  - Set `reasoning_effort="low"` to save tokens
  - Use `verbosity="high"` for research, `"medium"` for analysis
- DON'T create 1000+ line calculation engines - GPT-5 handles the math
- DO copy the exact working pattern from `valuation_agent.py`
- DO use `respond_with_web_search()` for research, `create_completion()` for analysis

**File Writing Pattern (from valuation_agent.py):**
```python
# Write to research database following exact pattern:
research_dir = f"research_database/sessions/{session_id}/{ticker}/strategic"
temp_path = f"{research_dir}/temp_competition.md"
strategic_path = f"{research_dir}/strategic_analysis.md"
```

## Testing

### Test File Location
- Unit tests: `tests/unit/agents/test_strategic_agent.py`
- Integration tests: `tests/integration/test_strategic_workflow.py`
- Manual tests: `tests/manual_tests/`

### Test Standards
- Use `pytest` framework
- Mock OpenAI client following Story 2.2 patterns
- Test both success and failure scenarios
- Verify research database file creation
- Use `py -m pytest` to run tests on Windows

### Testing Frameworks and Patterns
- Mock pattern from `tests/unit/agents/test_valuation_agent.py`
- Use `@patch.object(OpenAIClient, 'respond_with_web_search')` for mocking
- Test file should verify 2-step workflow completion
- Ensure proper `AgentResult` return structure

### Specific Testing Requirements
- Verify agent handles missing valuation context gracefully
- Test integration with agent coordinator
- Validate markdown output format
- Check citation presence in research output
- Test with real ticker symbols in manual tests
