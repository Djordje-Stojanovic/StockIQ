**UserSession Model Requirements:**
```python
class UserSession(BaseModel):
    session_id: str = Field(..., description="Unique session identifier")
    ticker_symbol: str = Field(..., description="Company ticker being analyzed")
    user_expertise_level: int = Field(..., ge=1, le=10, description="Calculated expertise (1-10)")
    assessment_responses: List[dict] = Field(default_factory=list)
    report_complexity: str = Field(..., pattern="^(comprehensive|executive)$")
    created_at: datetime = Field(default_factory=datetime.utcnow)
    status: str = Field(default="active", pattern="^(active|research|generation|complete|error)$")
    research_database_path: str = Field(..., description="Path to session research database")
```

### API Specifications
Based on [Source: architecture/api-specification.md#rest-api-specification]:

```

### Frontend Architecture Requirements
Based on [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#component-architecture]:

**Component Organization:**
- Main application logic in `static/js/app.js`
- Utility functions in `static/js/utils.js`
- Institutional styling in `static/css/styles.css`
- Single page application in `static/index.html`

**State Management:**
```typescript
interface AppState {
    currentSession: {
        sessionId: string;
        tickerSymbol: string;
        currentStep: 'ticker' | 'assessment' | 'research' | 'generation' | 'complete';
        expertiseLevel?: number;
        reportComplexity?: 'comprehensive' | 'executive';
    };
}
```

# - Session initialization
```

### Technology Stack Requirements
Based on [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]:

**Core Dependencies Already Available:**
- FastAPI 0.104+ for REST API
- Pydantic 2.0+ for data validation (UserSession model)
- JavaScript ES2022 for client-side logic
- Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS for simple interface

**Validation Requirements:**
- Use Pydantic validation for server-side ticker checking
- Client-side JavaScript for real-time validation feedback

### Coding Standards Requirements
Based on [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]:

**File Limits:**
- Maximum 500 lines per file
- Functions under 50 lines
- Line length max 100 characters

**Style Requirements:**
- Type hints required for all functions
- Google-style docstrings mandatory
- Use snake_case for variables/functions, PascalCase for classes
- Double quotes for strings

### Project Structure Alignment
No structural conflicts identified. All required directories exist from Story 1.1:
- `src/routers/` for assessment endpoints
- `src/services/` for session management
- `src/models/` for UserSession model
- `src/utils/` for validation utilities
- `static/` for frontend components

### Technical Constraints
- Local Windows 11 development only
- No external ticker validation APIs required for MVP
- Simple format checking sufficient for basic validation
